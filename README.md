# Reclaiming Roots

**Reclaiming Roots** is a platform that connects surplus government land, Indigenous land priorities, and environmental health data in one place.  
It supports Indigenous-led restoration efforts, rebuilds trust, and helps heal ecosystems through smarter governance and technology.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the gap between land acknowledgments and real action. Coming from South Asian and African family backgrounds, we have seen how colonization leaves lasting impacts on land, culture, and sovereignty. We also recognized the urgent environmental need to restore stewardship of the land.

## What it does
Reclaiming Roots allows governments, Indigenous communities, and citizens to access key land data in one platform. It provides maps, restoration opportunities, and a public space to support Indigenous-led initiatives.

## How we built it
- **Figma**: Website mockup design and user experience flow
- **Firebase**: Backend simulation of land data storage
- **JavaScript**: Processing and visualizing how real-world land data could interact with maps

## Challenges we ran into
- Lack of a centralized public database combining surplus land, Indigenous priorities, and environmental health
- Ensuring privacy, sovereignty, and trust were respected in data handling and platform design

## Accomplishments we're proud of
- Using technology to tackle a real-world problem
- Designing a platform that supports Indigenous leadership, environmental healing, and smarter governance
- Learning new tools while staying mission-focused

## What we learned
- Deepened our understanding of the Land Back movement and how sovereignty and environmental restoration are deeply connected
- Learned how important it is to work with stakeholders and center their voices in the design process

## What's next
- Build a full website using **React** and a stronger backend database
- Partner directly with Indigenous communities to co-design and expand the platform
- Integrate real surplus land datasets and environmental monitoring features
